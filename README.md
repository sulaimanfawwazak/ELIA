![ELIA](./ELIA-in-action.png)

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using vector embeddings and a document retrieval system. The chatbot can process user queries and provide relevant answers based on pre-embedded documents. ELIA is the successor of ERIKA, a regex-based Discord bot. You can read more about ERIKA from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sulaimanfawwazak/ERIKA).
